      <!-- WHY THIS EXISTS -->
      <section class="space-y-3 max-w-2xl">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Why this exists</h2>

        <p>
          There is a great deal of noise around attention, focus, and emotional regulation —
          particularly online.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some people arrive already convinced of an explanation. Others feel unsure,
          dismissed, or overwhelmed by conflicting narratives.
        </p>

        <p>
          MindWorks is designed to sit in the space between curiosity and certainty —
          offering structured reflection without labels.
        </p>

        <p class="font-medium">
          The aim is clarity, not classification.

      <!-- WHY CLARITY MATTERS -->
      <section class="space-y-3 max-w-2xl">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Why clarity matters</h2>

        <p class="text-slate-700">
          Patterns often described as “ADHD” can affect decision-making, emotional range,
          access to clarity, and overall quality of life.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-700">
          When patterns are poorly understood, people often experience them as fixed or defining.
          When they are seen clearly, they can be related to differently.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-700">
          Understanding how and why certain patterns operate can, in itself,
          create meaningful freedom — without diagnosis, medication, or adopting an identity.
