        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700 max-w-2xl">
          If you’ve been noticing recurring patterns in attention, focus, or emotional regulation,
          and want a grounded way to think about them, this reflection offers a place to pause
          before drawing conclusions.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-700 max-w-2xl">
          It’s designed for people who sense that something meaningful may be going on —
          and want clarity rather than quick answers.

      <!-- WHY THIS EXISTS -->
      <section class="space-y-4 max-w-2xl">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Why this exists</h2>

        <p>There’s a lot of noise around ADHD.</p>

        <p>
          Some people arrive already convinced. Others feel unsure, dismissed, or overwhelmed
          by conflicting information. Many simply sense that
          <em>something isn’t quite working</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          MindWorks is designed to sit in that in-between space —
          after curiosity begins, but before labels are applied.
        </p>

        <p class="font-medium">
          The aim is clarity, not certainty.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- WHY CLARITY MATTERS -->
      <section class="space-y-4 max-w-2xl">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Why clarity matters</h2>

        <p class="text-slate-700">
          Patterns often described as “ADHD” can have real consequences —
          shaping decision-making, access to clarity, emotional range,
          and overall quality of life.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-700">
          When patterns remain unnamed or poorly understood, people often feel
          at the mercy of them. When patterns are recognised clearly,
          they can be seen for what they are — and related to differently.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-700">
          This reflection is built on the premise that understanding
          <em>why you tend to operate as you do</em>
          can, in itself, create a degree of freedom —
          without diagnosis, medication, or adopting an identity.

          <li>You’re wondering whether ongoing difficulties are worth taking seriously</li>
          <li>You notice patterns over time, not just isolated bad days</li>
          <li>You want psychological grounding without being pushed toward an identity</li>

        <p class="text-slate-700">
          You don’t need to be sure of anything to begin.

          <li>

          MindWorks reflections were developed by

          a UK-trained psychotherapist and registered mental health nurse,

          The work draws on formal clinical frameworks and long-term professional practice,
          translated into accessible psychological language.
